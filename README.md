This online store is a work in progress. For this time we implemented the following functionalities:
- Create/Login a admin acount using: Username - admin and Password - admin
- Create any other account going to the sign up page and filling the form.
- when logging in as admin you have a button called "user control" where you can delete/create/update an existing user in the database.
- when logging in as a regular customer you dont have that option.
